# Sports Analysis Project: Durham County U13 Player Ratings

## Overview

This project is part of a Master's thesis submitted to Durham University, focusing on sports analysis, particularly identifying the top under-13 players in Durham County. The project leverages a combination of unsupervised machine learning techniques and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to achieve this objective.

The project also includes a supplementary tool—a Player Rating Calculator for Durham County—available through the link below, which was made with a simple ML model. This calculator demonstrates the project's potential for future expansion, where advanced machine learning models or neural networks could be integrated using Flask. However, such extensions are beyond the scope of the current project.

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Identify the top under-13 players in Durham County.
2. **Extended Work or Further Enhancements:** Developed a supplementary Player Rating Calculator to demonstrate the potential for expansion using web technologies.

## Methodology

The project employs a multidisciplinary approach, combining concepts from:

- **Web Technologies:**
  - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for frontend development.
  - **Web Scraping and Crawling** to gather relevant sports data.
  
- **Data Science and Machine Learning:**
  - **Unsupervised Machine Learning:** Clustering techniques to analyze player performance data.
  - **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP):** A structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions.
  - **Data Visualization:** Python libraries to create insightful visual representations of the data.
  
- **Ethics in Data Science:** Ensuring responsible and ethical use of data, particularly with respect to minors.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For developing the interactive web interface.
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning algorithms.

## Future Work

While the current project focuses on identifying top players, future work could involve:

- **Integration of Neural Networks:** Enhancing the predictive capabilities of the player rating system.
