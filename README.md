# Dissertation on sports analysis

## This project is a part of masters thesis submitted to Durham University

The link below directs you to a webpage that outlines the results and includes a player rating calculator for Durham County. This is a supplementary project, not the main focus, and could be expanded in the future by deploying advanced machine learning models or neural networks through Flask. However, this additional work is outside the scope of the current project.

The primary goal of this project is to identify the top under-13 players in Durham County, achieved using unsupervised machine learning techniques and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).
